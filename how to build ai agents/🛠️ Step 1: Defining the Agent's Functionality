# üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Defining the Agent's Functionality  

## Understanding the Agent's Purpose  

### Identify the Use Case:  
- Clearly define the problem the agent will solve or the task it will perform.  
- Examples include customer support, content generation, data analysis, etc.  

### Specify Goals and Tasks:  
- Break down the primary goal into smaller, actionable tasks.  
- Define clear objectives and expected outcomes for each task.  

### Determine Inputs and Outputs:  
- Identify the inputs the agent will need to perform its tasks.  
- Define the expected outputs or responses from the agent.  

## Determine Core Capabilities  
- **Information retrieval** (e.g. Wikipedia search)  
- **Data analysis** (e.g. calculations)  
- **Domain-specific tasks** (e.g. blog search)
